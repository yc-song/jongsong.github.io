Hello! I‚Äôm Jonghyun (Jong) Song, a Ph.D. student in Data Science at Seoul National University, advised by [Professor Jay-Yoon Lee](https://www.skiml.snu.ac.kr/). Before joining GSDS, I was trained to be a junior engineer at the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering of the same school ([Dept. of MAE, SNU](https://me.snu.ac.kr/)).

My primary research interests include **Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval (IR), and Multi-modal Language Models.** I‚Äôm particularly fascinated by language model embeddings‚Äîthe idea of encoding vast information into numerical representations is inspiring. In this regard, I‚Äôm exploring how to optimize these embeddings for downstream tasks, specifically focusing on efficient modeling of query-document and document-document interactions in IR systems. Also, I‚Äôm interested in advancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models for multi-modal tasks, enabling them to interpret and connect diverse data types more effectively. For more details, please refer to my [CV](https://yc-song.github.io/files/Jong_CV.pdf).

In my free time, I like to play tennis :tennis: and watch soccer games :soccer: (I'm a fan of 1. FSV MAINZ 05 in Bundesliga!)
